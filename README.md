# Hyperledger-Fabric-project-for-Business-Network-of-a-Finance-Company
This mini-project aims at creating a business network for a finance company. It contains five entities: Buyer, seller, provider, shipper and finance company that provides loan. The use case of this project is that the seller will accept orders from buyer and sell products from provider to the buyer. If the product is unavailable with the provider, the seller will reject that buyer's orders. In case, there is huge order placed, the buyers can use financial company to pay for the orders. This code can be deployed on Bluemix.
